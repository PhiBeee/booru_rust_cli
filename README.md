# CLI Booru downloader

There is a lot of tools like this but I haven't found one in Rust, so I just decided to make my own.  
I like to run things from my terminal so that's what this will be.  

# Usage

Make sure you have rust installed, install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you don't have it yet.  
  
Clone the repository to some directory (or download the project)  
`git clone https://github.com/PhiBeee/booru_rust_cli.git`  
  
Navigate to the directory and run:  
`cargo run -- <amount_of_images> <tags>`  
Images should then start downloading to /images/gelbooru
